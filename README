Intelligent juggling balls
--------------------------

*** Project in progress ***


This will become the code base for my juggling ball project.

I will build a collection of juggling balls. Each with an accelerometer (for
sensing movements) and Xbee chip (for wireless comunication) attached.

The aim is to enrich juggling with some lighting and sound effects. More
information will follow.
